# BLACKSKY-MD Heroku Connection Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the "Could not send notification - missing connection or user" error and other Heroku deployment issues.

## 1. Enhanced Connection Handling

We've implemented a robust connection handling system that:

- **Detects Connection Drops**: The system now properly detects when the WhatsApp connection is dropped.
- **Implements Automatic Reconnection**: Using an exponential backoff algorithm to avoid rate limiting.
- **Provides Better Error Reporting**: Detailed logs on connection status and reconnection attempts.

### Key Files Added/Modified:

- **`notification-queue.js`**: Implements a persistent notification queue system
- **`FIX-CONNECTION-ERROR.md`**: Comprehensive guide to understanding and fixing connection issues
- **`backup-sessions.js`**: Maintains session persistence across Heroku dynos

## 2. Message Queue System

We've created a notification queue system that:

- **Persists Notifications**: Messages are stored and retried when connection is unavailable.
- **Survives Dyno Cycling**: Queue is saved to both filesystem and database.
- **Implements Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed message delivery.

## 3. Session Persistence

We've implemented multiple layers of session persistence:

- **Local Backups**: Automatically backs up session files to a local backup directory.
- **Database Storage**: Stores session data in PostgreSQL for retrieval after dyno cycling.
- **Automatic Restoration**: Detects missing session files and restores them from backups.

## 4. Heroku-Specific Optimizations

We've added several Heroku-specific optimizations:

- **Memory Management**: Added garbage collection and memory optimization flags.
- **Dyno Configuration**: Updated app.json with proper formation and stack settings.
- **Environment Variables**: Added new environment variables for fine-tuning reconnection behavior.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Enhanced the health check endpoint for more reliable operation.

## 5. How to Use the New Features

1. **For New Deployments**: 
   - Use the updated app.json and Procfile
   - Include all the new files in your repository

2. **For Existing Deployments**:
   - Add the new files (notification-queue.js, backup-sessions.js)
   - Update your app.json and Procfile
   - Add the new environment variables through Heroku dashboard or CLI

## Recommended Heroku Configuration

For optimal performance and reliability:

- Use at least the "Eco" plan ($5/month) for your dyno
- Add the PostgreSQL "Mini" plan ($5/month) for session persistence
- Configure scheduled backups using the Heroku Scheduler
- Set up a monitoring service like UptimeRobot to ping your health check endpoint

## Testing Your Deployment

After implementing these fixes, verify the following:

1. The bot reconnects automatically after connection drops
2. Messages sent during connection loss are delivered when connection is restored
3. Session persists through dyno restarts
4. Memory usage remains stable over time

## Important Notes

- The free tier of Heroku has been discontinued. The minimum required plan is now "Eco" ($5/month).
- These fixes significantly improve reliability but cannot guarantee 100% uptime. WhatsApp's API may still have occasional issues.
- Regular maintenance and monitoring are still recommended for optimal performance.
