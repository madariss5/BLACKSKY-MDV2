# BLACKSKY-MD Premium - Heroku Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes all the optimizations and fixes implemented to ensure BLACKSKY-MD Premium runs optimally on Heroku.

## ‚úÖ Configured Files

1. **Procfile**
   - Updated to use direct `index.js` execution rather than PM2
   - Configured both web and worker dynos properly
   - Added necessary directory creation commands

2. **heroku.yml**
   - Updated worker command to use `index.js` directly
   - Configured web process to use `connection-patch.js`
   - Maintained PostgreSQL addon configuration

3. **app.json**
   - Properly configured for one-click Heroku deployment
   - Added all necessary environment variables
   - Set up required buildpacks for ffmpeg and webp

4. **index.js**
   - Added Heroku platform detection
   - Implemented adaptive logging based on platform
   - Set up integration with `heroku-connection-fix.js`
   - Uses process.env.PORT for proper Heroku binding

## üõ†Ô∏è Specialized Heroku Modules

1. **heroku-connection-fix.js**
   - Custom connection recovery tailored for Heroku's dyno cycling
   - Implements more frequent connection checks (every 30s)
   - Contains specialized reconnection logic with reduced timeouts
   - Includes automatic session backup system

2. **connection-patch.js**
   - Provides HTTP health-check endpoint for Heroku
   - Implements keepalive mechanisms to prevent dyno sleeping
   - Monitors connection status with detailed logging

3. **backup-sessions.js**
   - Periodically backs up WhatsApp session data to PostgreSQL
   - Implements file system backup as additional redundancy
   - Adds automatic restoration system for corrupted sessions

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

1. **Connection System**
   - Reduced reconnection delay from 60s to 10s
   - Improved error detection and reporting
   - Added platform-specific connection handlers

2. **Notification Queue**
   - Increased queue processing frequency (5s vs 60s)
   - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Implemented queue persistence across restarts

3. **Memory Management**
   - Added Heroku-specific memory optimization
   - Implemented periodic garbage collection
   - Added memory monitoring with auto-restart for high usage

## üåê Documentation

1. **HEROKU-SETUP-GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive guide for deploying on Heroku
   - Step-by-step instructions for both automatic and manual deployment
   - Detailed troubleshooting section

2. **HEROKU-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md**
   - Quick reference for environment variables
   - Overview of available Heroku optimization options
   - Tips for scaling and performance

## üìå Summary of Key Changes

- Changed execution model from PM2 to direct Node.js for Heroku compatibility
- Implemented specialized connection handling for Heroku's ephemeral filesystem
- Added robust session backup and restoration mechanisms
- Reduced all timeouts and delays for faster recovery
- Improved logging and error reporting specific to Heroku environment
- Added complete documentation for deployment and troubleshooting
